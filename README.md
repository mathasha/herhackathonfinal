# herhackathonfinal

This notebook is written to analyze the literacy rates across the country in various states. Idea is to help the government improve the literacy across various states for females and understand why there are gaps. At the time know which is the highest state having literacy and which one is the least.

Identify the problem area, apply models and achive the outcome, where our objective is to hike the female literacy rate.

On similar lines , if we have the data set we will also enhance this to know more on career prospects. Since this hackathon was only restricted to India, we could not go ahead with this solution however will later do it across the world.
